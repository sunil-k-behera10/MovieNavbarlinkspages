        The definition of service is â€œany intangible product, which is essentially a transaction and is transferred from the buyer to the seller in exchange for some consideration (or no consideration). Let us take a look at some of the characteristics of a service.

        Intangibility: A service is not a physical product that you can touch or see. A service can be experienced by the buyer or the receiver. Also, you can not judge the quality of the service before consumption.
        Inconsistency: There can be no perfect standardization of services. Even if the service provider remains the same, the quality of the service may differ from time to time.
        Inseparability: One unique characteristic of services is that the service and the service provider cannot be separated. Unlike with goods/products the manufacturing and the consumption of services cannot be separated by storage.
        Storage: The production and consumption of services are not inseparable because storage of services is not possible. Being an intangible transaction there can never be an inventory of services.
